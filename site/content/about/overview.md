## Project

OpenFrontend enables tourism websites to be created more quickly. From the conception to the development of the frontend. The prefabricated components save a lot of time, reduce maintenance costs and allow third parties easier access to the industry-specific requirements of a website as well as the connection to backend systems.

This is why OpenFrontend was supported by Innotour.

Innotour is a SECO funding program in Switzerland that supports innovation and cooperation in the tourism sector in order to strengthen its competitiveness and sustainability.
