## Overview
By default, it operates on a scale of 1-5 stars, but this can be easily adjusted. Users can rate items or see average ratings, depending on how you set up the component.

## Examples
To make the most out of the Ratings component, letâ€™s explore its various configuration options, which are provided via JSON attributes.

### Basic Example
This example demonstrates a quick and easy way to add the Ratings component to your webpage and retrieve the clicked rating:

{{< example >}}
<div data-of-rating id="rating"></div>

<script>
  const element = document.getElementById('rating');

  element.addEventListener('clicked.of.rating', (event) => {
    alert(`Clicked rating: ${event.detail.rating}`);
    element.rating.readOnly(true);
  });
</script>
{{< /example >}}

### Score
You can preset a score for the Ratings component, which might represent an average score from multiple users. This is achieved using the JSON configuration.

{{< example >}}
<div data-of-rating='{"score": 3}'></div>
{{< /example >}}

### Read only
To display a rating without allowing further user interactions (e.g., in cases where you just want to show an average score), use the JSON configuration with the `readOnly` property

{{< example >}}
<div data-of-rating='{"score": 3, "readOnly": true }'></div>
{{< /example >}}

### Half Ratings
The Ratings component supports half-star increments, offering a more refined scoring system, especially useful for averages that fall between whole numbers. To enable this feature, it's essential to set the `half` attribute to `true` within the JSON configuration. You can also adjust the `number` property to define the maximum number of stars, if you wish to operate on scales other than the default 1-5.

{{< example >}}
<div data-of-rating='{"half": true, "number": 10, "score": 7.5 }'></div>
{{< /example >}}

With this configuration, you'll have a 10-star rating system with the current score set at 7.5 stars.

### Extra options

You can pass extra options as JSON value of the data attribute.

Here is the list of all available options (alphabetically):

{{< bs-table "table" >}}
| Option | Type | Default | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `half` | `Boolean` | `false` | Enables half star selection. |
| `number` | `Number` | `5` | The number of stars that will be presented. |
| `readOnly` | `Boolean` | `false` | Turns the rating read-only. |
| `score` | `Number` | `undefined` | Initial rating. |
{{< /bs-table >}}
